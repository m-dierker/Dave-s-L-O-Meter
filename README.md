There are many great mysteries on earth. Can the NSA indeed read everything we're saying? How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop? What is the airspeed of an unladen swallow? However, there is one mystery that is greater than all others:

How many L's does [Dave Fontenot](https://facebook.com/davefontenot) type in "Hel(l+) yeah"?

Is there a magic number, or does it grow and fade with the tides? Maybe there's a secret formula? There are endless possibilities and today I am proud to announce Dave's L-O-Meter, a Chrome extension to begin to solve this world mystery. The extension passively looks for Dave comments that match the format "Hellllll yeah" and records the number of L's it sees to a central server. Soon enough, we'll be able to visualize the L's and perhaps, one day, take a stab at the noble cause of understanding them.
